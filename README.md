# Places. React JS Application

This is a ReactJS application for learning about countries around the globe using the RESTAPI from restcountries.com ReactJS was used as the Javascript framework to develop with component-driven code. Due to the limitations of the API, some dynamic components are not linked to the API, but in future iterations with an improved API, could be. For example, the background image is currently randomly generated, but would be better if it was linked to the country API. Further interactivity could be enhanced, potentially making the site a travel app or something similar.
